# Flashpoint-Learning
Working with a team of six other software developers with SCRUM methodology, I managed the front-end development of a full-stack, progressive web application built with React.js, Node.js, Spring Boot, and deployed with Amazon Web Services.

Developed End to End test automation strategies in support of our continuous integration and delivery pipeline.

Maintained our product backlog and repository, scheduling and assignment of tasks, and arranged bi-monthly code reviews and client meetings, to render a contract from SRS to shippable product.
